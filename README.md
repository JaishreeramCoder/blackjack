# BlackJack Reinforcement Learning Model
This project involves training a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model using the Monte Carlo method with a constant learning rate (Î±) to play the game of BlackJack. 

## Evaluation Results
The model was evaluated over multiple games with the following outcomes:

* Win Rate: 42.424%

* Draw Rate: 5.889%

* Loss Rate: 51.687%
